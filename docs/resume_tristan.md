### Work History

**2018.6 - current**    **Senior Java Engineer**  

Beijing Oufei Technology Co., Ltd,      Located: Beijing

#### Project1: Nigeria Loan App - OKash

Okash is a cash loan application for individuals. Users can obtain a loanable limit by submitting information and risk control, and obtain loans through bank loans after confirming loans.  Website: https://ng.o-kash.com/web/homeEn.html.

As a back-end developer, We mainly use  **Java + SprintBoot + Mybatis + Mysql + Redis + xxl-job** as the project technology stack. And I am mainly responsible for designing and developing user information, loan application and confirmation process and other modules.

**My Key Result:**

* I designed and developed a function of using bits to save user order status information, reducing 80% of redundant codes.
* I developed a data service about the user's historical orders to support the risk judgment basis of the risk team. Save about 60% of audit time.
* I once found and reported a hidden error, which resulted in an abnormal increase in the quota of more than 1000 users,  and reduced business losses.
* The functions I developed rarely make mistakes, and there are few delays.
* I get A+ performance every year.



#### Project2: Nigeria And Egypt Loan BI System

BI system is a visual report system for managers and operators to view business operation data.We use **Hadoop, hive, spark and airflow** to do ETL tasks, and **Tableau, Davinci** to do visual reports.

In addition to the normal function development, I am also responsible for maintaining the historical data of user loans used by risk team, so when the BI system is established, I am also responsible for additional maintenance of the BI system.

**My Key Result:**

* I transformed the old BI system from using mysql stored procedures to calculate ETL to using Hadoop+Hive.  
* By dividing the subject field and the dw process, I created a relatively standardized dimensional modeling database, which improved the report loading speed.
* I led 2 team members to complete BI development and maintenance of 5 apps in 2 countries.
* Developed applications and software to increase department efficiency.
* I introduced automatic mail to send yesterday's key business indicators every day, which was appreciated by leaders.



#### Project3: Kenya Loan Debt Collection System

The collection system is a system used by the collection operation team. Its main functions include automatic collection of documents to be collected, automatic dispatch of documents according to daily attendance of employees, statistics of personnel performance, and collection of data reports.

We use **Java + SprintBoot + Mybatis + Mysql  ** to develop this system.

**My Key Result:**

* Develop automatic grouping function and improve automatic order splitting function，It solves the tedious and error prone work manually assigned by the local manager every day.
* Introduce multi-threaded order allocation, reducing the initial 10 minute order splitting to 2 minutes.
